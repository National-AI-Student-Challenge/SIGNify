# SIGNify


## Overview of Application
<hr> 
SIGNify is an AI-powered app for the hearing impaired, as part of the National AI Student Challenge 2023. SIGNify is free and utilises cutting-edge technology for real-time ASL-to-text translation, grammatical correction, and sentiment analysis. Our goal is to make a positive impact on the hearing impaired community.

## Project Description 
<hr> 
American Sign Language (ASL) is the primary form of communication for individuals who are deaf and hard of hearing (D&M). This is because their only communication-related disability is an inability to use spoken language, and thus they rely solely on sign language to communicate.<br /><br />

The main focus of this project is to create a model that can accurately recognize hand gestures used in fingerspelling, with the ultimate goal of forming complete words by combining each individual gesture.

The gestures that were trained for this project are depicted in the image provided below.<br/><br/>
